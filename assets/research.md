## Paper Outline

#### Chapters 1,2,3,4,7

### Chapter 1:Introduction

- Only simple graphs. No multiple edges or self edges.
- Random generation of graphs are used in simulations and testing frequently.

### Chapter 2: Graphical Sequences

- Definition of a degree sequence and graphicality.
- Erdos-Gallai graphicality criterion.
- Havel-Hakimi Recursion for graphicality criterion.

### Chapter 3: Previous Algorihtms for Generating Random Graphs

- Several large networks obey power-law degree distribution.
- Pairing Model: Bipartite Perfect Matching
    - For large n, quickly halts without proper generation.
- Havel-Hakimi variants and Adjacency Lists
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo variants

### Chapter 4: Sequential Algorithm

- Not much to mention.

### Chapter 5: Running Time of Sequential Algorithm

- No restarts are needed.
- Graphicality check: O(n)
- Worst case:O(n^3d)
-
